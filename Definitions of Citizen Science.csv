Australian Citizen Science Association,Citizen science involves public participation and collaboration in scientific research with the aim to increase scientific knowledge. ItÍs a great way to harness community skills and passion to fuel the capacity of science to answer our questions about the world and how it works. European Citizen Science Association,Citizen Science - the involvement of citizens in research activities.EU 2017 LAB Ð FAB Ð APP Ñ Investing in the European future we want,citizen science É where citizens become providers and users of data. This will reinforce and give new meaning to the policy of open access to publications and data; this openness should enable citizens and citizen groups to participate in evidence-based policy and decision-making.(US) Citizen Science Association,Citizen science is the involvement of the public in scientific research _ whether community-driven research or global investigations.Group on Earth Observations Citizen Science Working Group,Citizen Science encompasses a range of methodologies that encourage and support the contributions of the public to the advancement of scientific and engineering research and monitoring in ways that may include: Co-identifying research questions; Co-designing/conducting investigations; Co-designing/building/testing low cost sensors;Co-collecting and analyzing data; Co-developing data applications; Collaboratively solving complex problems.US Citizenscience.gov,"In citizen science, the public participates voluntarily in the scientific process, addressing real-world problems in ways that may include formulating research questions, conducting scientific experiments, collecting and analyzing data, interpreting results, making new discoveries, developing technologies and applications, and solving complex problems. "US Crowdsourcing and Citizen Act (15 USC 3724),"The term ñcitizen scienceî means a form of open collaboration in which individuals or organizations participate in the scientific process in various ways, including„ (A) enabling the formulation of research questions; (B) creating and refining project design; (C) conducting scientific experiments; (D) collecting and analyzing data; (E) interpreting the results of data;(E) interpreting the results of data;(F) developing technologies and applications;(G) making discoveries; and(H) solving problems."National Geographic Encyclopedia,"Citizen science is the practice of public participation and collaboration in scientific research to increase scientific knowledge. Through citizen science, people share and contribute to data monitoring and collection programs."National Institute of Health,"Citizen science efforts are driven by community concerns. These community-led projects may involve a partnership with an academic or research institution, where both parties work together to collect and share data. The goal is to address a community concern through collaborative research, and to translate the research findings into public health action that benefits the community."U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,"Citizen science is a form of open collaboration in which individuals or organizations participate voluntarily in the scientific process in various ways, including collecting and analyzing data. Citizen science provides a way for members of the public to participate and support EPA programs."National Aeronautics and Space Administration,Citizen Science is defined as a form of open collaboration in which individuals or organizations participate voluntarily in the scientific process in various ways. This policy defines ñCitizen Science Projectsî as science projects that rely on volunteers. "Bonn, et al. (2016) Green Paper Citizen Science Strategy 2020 for Germany.","Citizen Science describes the process of generating knowledge through various participatory formats. Participation can range from the short-term collection of data to the intensive use of leisure time to delve deeper into a research topic together with scientists and/or other volunteers, to ask questions, and to get involved in some or all phases of the research process"UNEP Global Environment Outlook 6 (Chapter 25),"Citizen science entails the engagement of volunteers in science and research. Volunteers are commonly involved in data collection, but can also be involved in initiating questions, designing projects, disseminating results and interpreting data."
